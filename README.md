# Simplest node authentication

A starting point to create an express.js site with authentication.

The code is based on the excellent tutorial [Easy Node Authentication](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local) which is good, but not so easy!

The users and passwords are harcoded and not encrypted, but this way, using a database is not very difficult to do. I have also removed many dependencies and the option of adding a new user.
